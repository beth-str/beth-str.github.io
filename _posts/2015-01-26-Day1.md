title:  "Day 1: Welcome to OCS!"
---

It is Day 1 at OCS.  I would say the mood is hesitantly lively.  Sadly, we lost our most exuberant student, James, but in a good way, since he got a job!  Congratulations, James!

We also learned the word "Truthy" which we will all be striving to use in interviews - we are convinced this will guarantee us a job!

What I learned today:

Terminal Commands:
  cd ~ (goes to home)
  ls (shows a list of files in current directory)
  cd .. (moves up one level in the directory)
  cd ../class-budai (moves up one level and creates a new folder at the same time)
  (tab auto completes from choices within the directory)
  open (opens an external file)
  touch (creates a new file)
  mate . (opens all files in current folder in textmate)

GIT Commands:
  git init (initialize a folder with git capability)
  git status (show current git status of that folder)
  git add (move files onto the stage)
  (alternately 'git add .' move ALL files in the folder onto the stage)
  git commit (commit changes to the repository - write and save the message to complete this action; to cancel do not add message and close)
  git log (see timeline with all the commits)


Also command + return inserts new line - YUM!
