title:  "Day 2: Things are getting more difficult!"

It is Day 2: 27-jan-2015.  

I would like to eliminate the word "foo" from all code examples.  There are way too many sites that have examples that are utterly useless to me, b/c they dwell in the depths of abstraction.  I like concrete, practical examples that I can connect to real life and that help me see a real application for something.  Thank you, BankAccount.  Thank you, CheckSplitter.  

Today I tried to understand a lot of things, but it didn't go well.  Things will look brighter in the morning.
