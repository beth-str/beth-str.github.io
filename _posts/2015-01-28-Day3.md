It is Day 3: 28-jan-2015.

Only 1/3 of the class was able to complete the Dinner Club program successfully. Steven showed his code sample and it was truly astounding.  I loved that beautiful code and the completed documentation so much.  I wondered how he knew how to do all that.

-logic in a method - who knew?
-pushing things into an array during initialize - who knew?
-using an object as an array value - who knew?
-writing code to test your code (Allison told me that)
-i got a lot of good ideas from Steven's code - that was really good code
-when you write code to test your code you try to break your program
-you write tests for:
  1. verification - make sure code works when it should
  2. error handling - make sure it handles errors / edge cases
  3. debugging - make sure bug does not reappear
  4. specification - state how your problem should work
  
My issue with seeing things in objects and getting data out of objects seems to be faulty, but I still do not fully understand it.  To get things in and out of an object:

p = dc.members["Batman"]
p.class => Person
p.name => "Batman"
p.spending_amount => 0
p.spend => 50

The issue is that you have to write all those methods in the class in order to get those things OUT of the object.  Methods do the work for us.  I think Skyler had an aha moment about this; I should ask him about that tomorrow.  I am still waiting for my aha moment.
