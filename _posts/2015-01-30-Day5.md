It is Day 5: 30-jan-2015.

Time to work on Rock-Paper-Scissors today and additional review sessions in the afternoon.   

Qdoba for lunch - yum!

	•	What is something you've learned so far that you could probably teach (i.e. explain to a reasonable degree of completion) to an interested but unexperienced friend?
Probably nothing with any authority.  
  
	•	What is something you think others in the class understand much better than you. Be very, very specific. Even if you're feeling insecure and want to say, "Pretty much everything". Pick something specific.
Classes and methods. Specifically, how information is passed between classes and methods (or, rather, how information is passed between objects).

	•	Describe one or two highlights from this week that have nothing to do with coding.
-Spring-like weather in January made for nice walks around the lake.  

-Exploring / becoming familiar in a new city.
