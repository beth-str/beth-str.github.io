###Q: Describe the difference between "gems" and "APIs".
>I really have no earthly idea.  Well, OK, gems are specialized little mini-programs that install to the ruby main and they allow us to do things so we don't have to write the code to do those things ourselves. As in, parse a phone number to the correct format, truncate text, and other helpful tools.

>API is something that some websites make available to developers that allows them to write their own code utilizing the data and information (??) that is available on that site.  I suppose they do this b/c the more programs and what-nots that developers write using their characters and proprietary information, the more it builds their brand.  And it is very friendly to the developer-community. Unfortunately, despite all this friendliness and love, a wrapper is still a difficult concept for me to understand.
