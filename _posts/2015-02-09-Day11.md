It is Day 11: Monday, 9-feb-2015.

####Q: What is "software development" as you understand it so far? What are the moving parts? Are those always the moving parts? Are they always called the same thing?
> I am not certain I really do understand it at all.  In fact, I am not sure what these questions are asking... I think there is a "front end" and a "back end," and also some graphic artist people thrown in for good measure.  I get confused by the terms software development, web development, web applications, etc.  

-client-side specialist = html developer = front-end (?)
-server-side = ruby (or other logic language) = back-end (?)

####Q:Discuss at least one reason why working in a pair was valuable. 
> It is helpful to troubleshoot / de-bug with another set of eyes. Sometimes when you are really stuck it is nice to feel like you are not alone in that - someone else is stuck with you.  Hmmm.  That doesn't sound good, does it?

> I would say that you can split things up and accomplish more, but that is not really the point of pair programming.  Still trying to get the hang of that.
